# Rules derived from experience in infrastructure teams
As a person who has been a member/team leader of an infrastructure team, I decided to write down my mistakes and experiences once for all.

- Simple processes and architectures precedes complexity.
- Using IaC (Infrastructure as Code) precedes documentation.
- Tacking problems once noticed precedes procrastination.
- Focusing on a single task with full attention precedes working on multiple task with less attention.
- Sharing knowledge and experience precedes reliance on person who is single point of failure.
- Immutable architecture precedes Mutable architecture.
- Making repetitious and time-consuming processes with high chance of failure precedes handling them manually.
- Maintaining Iac with VCS precedes maintaining them in servers or personal computers of infrastructure team members.
- Backup/Restore mechanism as a part of every process precedes handling them later as separate tasks
- Having an epistle checklist for any important and unimportant deploy change precedes mental checklist.

**P.S:** These rules are not absolute and may evolve during time.

**P.S:** The real world usually differs from theory. If you need to break a rule, make sure it is broken intentionally,
and have plans for its consequences and inform others. .
